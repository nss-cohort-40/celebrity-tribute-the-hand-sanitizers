            Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage, better known as Joe Exotic, is an
            American former zoo operator, aspiring musician and politician. The
            former owner and operator of the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal
            Park (a.k.a. G. W. Zoo) in Wynnewood, Oklahoma, Maldonado-Passage
            had claimed to be the most prolific breeder of tigers in the United
            States. He unsuccessfully ran twice for public office, first for
            President of the United States in 2016 as an independent, and then
            for Governor of Oklahoma in 2018 as a Libertarian.

            For over 20 years he was the owner and operator of the Greater G. W.
            Zoo, best known for its big cats. He operated an online reality
            television show that he streamed from his zoo. Over the years, he
            also operated sideshows around the country where he allowed people
            to pet tiger cubs. He also staged shows at fairs and in shopping
            malls.<br />The 2020 documentary series that's wildly popular on
            Netflix, Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness, is centered on
            Maldonado-Passage. He had previously appeared in the Louis Theroux
            documentary America's Most Dangerous Pets.[

            Maldonado-Passage was an aspiring country singer. Under the pretense
            of obtaining music for a planned reality television series, he
            commissioned country songs from other artists, with his creative
            contributions reportedly being limited to suggesting song topics and
            singing some backing vocals. He then produced music videos for the
            songs and posted them on YouTube, depicting himself as the main
            performer and taking full credit for the music, allegedly without
            having notified the actual artists. In 2015, he released a video for
            the song "Here Kitty Kitty", a diss track against Carole Baskin. In
            the video, he had a Baskin look-alike feeding her second husband,
            Don Lewis, to the tigers. Lewis has been missing since 1997, and was
            declared dead in 2002.
