        <h1>Intro to Artist</h1>
        <p>
          Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage, better known as Joe Exotic, is an
          American former zoo operator, aspiring musician and politician. The
          former owner and operator of the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park
          (a.k.a. G. W. Zoo) in Wynnewood, Oklahoma, Maldonado-Passage had
          claimed to be the most prolific breeder of tigers in the United
          States. He unsuccessfully ran twice for public office, first for
          President of the United States in 2016 as an independent, and then for
          Governor of Oklahoma in 2018 as a Libertarian.

        <h1>TV & Film</h1>
        <p>
          For over 20 years he was the owner and operator of the Greater G. W.
          Zoo, best known for its big cats. He operated an online reality
          television show that he streamed from his zoo. Over the years, he also
          operated sideshows around the country where he allowed people to pet
          tiger cubs. He also staged shows at fairs and in shopping malls.<br />The
          2020 documentary series that's wildly popular on Netflix, Tiger King:
          Murder, Mayhem and Madness, is centered on Maldonado-Passage. He had
          previously appeared in the Louis Theroux documentary America's Most
          Dangerous Pets.[

        <h1>Music</h1>
        <p>
          Maldonado-Passage was an aspiring country singer. Under the pretense
          of obtaining music for a planned reality television series, he
          commissioned country songs from other artists, with his creative
          contributions reportedly being limited to suggesting song topics and
          singing some backing vocals. He then produced music videos for the
          songs and posted them on YouTube, depicting himself as the main
          performer and taking full credit for the music, allegedly without
          having notified the actual artists. In 2015, he released a video for
          the song "Here Kitty Kitty", a diss track against Carole Baskin. In
          the video, he had a Baskin look-alike feeding her second husband, Don
          Lewis, to the tigers. Lewis has been missing since 1997, and was
          declared dead in 2002.
